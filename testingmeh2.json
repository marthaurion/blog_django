Would also explain how stuff could escape, if it was travelling faster than light until it left (weird point at the horizon, but that's there in any model). But this whole 3rd point is all speculation on my part. :P The alcubierre drive could theoretically time travel but we'd need a negative mass and some way to stop the whole thing superheating the ship and the stuff inside... (Is this fine? D:)\n\nI'm not a fan tbh, unless it's not a main ingredient. It's like Marmite :L Those curry ones sound tasty though...\n\nI think it's possible to time travel energy, but I guess it falls to philosophy to determine whether we'd still be the same person on the other side, even if we could somehow reassemble everything (in the full human time travel case). But I'd definitely go with it. In fact, I'd probably use this \"proof\" of time travel to inspire myself to try and get famous for being the guy who figured out how to time travel lol. The future me might actually include the details in the letter, unless I was the guy who figured it out in the first place so I'd know I could do it without my help... or something... (or he might have too much respect for science to steal someone else's idea before they could come up with it)\n\nTime travel is a concept that really interests me so I'll pretty much always be down for a time travel show.

But maybe the thing that made it a post apocalyptic world makes the survivors sleep longer? o.O\n\nI'm not a good judge of which of the two will go better overall since I haven't read Planetarian yet.

As of now there are a lot of foreshadowing and setting up going on here, some of those won't even make sense unless there is S2. Next few episodes will probably give you even more questions. The answers will come later but even those won't give you full picture because we are only going to get what the MC will get unless this is a split cour.\n\nOr just go and play the VN.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the anime.",

The tension between Lucia and Akane are high enough already.\n\nIsn't things simple? Koutarou decided the whole rainbow swamp(man made) thing is too dangerous. Proven by what happened to Inoue. RIP inoue.\n\nIf you want to know about where those weird Yoshino scenes come from, go and search \"Best Anime (Visual Novel) Moments - Trolling Yoshino\"\n\nThat was Koutarou idea of thanks(lol) btw.",

Also, Akihiro was thinking clearly even if he was fueled by rage. There is a difference. \nGaelio for example was enraged by McGillis' betrayel, and it clouded his mind causing him to fight terribly. \nI see no reason why Akihiro shouldn't have won. \nAlso, this was a chance for him to avenge a brother, which he wasn't able to do when Masahiro was killed. Mika did that. This was Akihiro's chance to shine, and boy he did!",

Fair enough having a temper tantrum when you become disillusioned and the like but take it out on Akechi and now Kobayashi (not that Kobayashi seems to care in the slightest).\nBesides, the older brother apparently had no ability to think things through ever. He didn't think through leaving the house, didn't think through latching on to the first person who was nice to him, and didn't think through how living in an armed compound was bound to end. It doesn't make him particularly endearing as a character so he has just become a plot point. A switch to flick for Hanasaki and really this show is just kind of boring me now.",

It seems that back in pre-Calamity War days, having everything be automated was a sign of wealth. They eventually sought to automate war entirely with no humans involved and thus created the MAs which were self-sustaining, self-repairing, and could learn. However, the MA systems evolved and instead they went out of control and became indiscriminate AI killing machines. The mobile suits, and especially the Gundams, were created to fight against the mobile armors, who at that time were \"countless\". \nSo...basically they were Skynet.\nOh, and Helmwige isn't a gundam, if that helps at all. It's a valkyrie unit like the red Grimgarde of last season. There have only been 4 or so gundams shown on screen, with Tekkadan having three of them.",

These:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mnqHdj0.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0QMfPtG.jpg\nAre the Elite soldiers in the manga that the anime makes ride toilet metal horses in-stead in the 1st episode.\n\n The art for both females is also extremely different, but I recommend you just check out/read the manga as it is *extremely* entertaining.

Tanya has the nickname of White Silver in anime or Argent in Manga.\n\nYet there is also a hidden/extra meaning about the \"Named Mage\" title.

Plus, half the time, it's my own fault 'cause I go sniffing around in wiki or tv tropes when I really shouldn't. My own reviews tend to be spoilery enough to warrant warnings. To stop rambling and answer you question, 'too much' would be plot points that would have been better left in the dark to maximize the enjoyment of a show. Taking Yuri on Ice again as example, I didn't mind knowing about the romantic milestones beforehand but had I known the results of the competitions, it would have hindered my excitement when I watched.",
