	- this file is located in the root directory (where manage.py is)

	- set up database connection information in the config.json file
- template structure is from django tutorial
    - uses a directory in root for global includes and a folder in each app (there's only one right now, blog) for specific templates
- trying to use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to help with maintaining requirements
    - using a virtualenv named "blog_django"
    - wasn't super intuitive to install psycopg2 (ended up having to run "easy_install" on the link to the windows executable)

    - post: standard stuff here. Title, slug (for link generation), body, publish date, category (foreign key and will be restricted to one), and excerpt (for the front page).
    - category: basic tree organization for categories. Title for category, slug (similar to post), and foreign key to category (this will hold the parent for the tree structure)
    
    
- creating an index page
    - basic view for now that just lists every post with the most recent one first
